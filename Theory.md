Array--> it is contiguous memory allocation of similar data type.
Disadvantages -it cannot change the size of array on run time/ dynamically.

But we also another option of vector which double its size on every complete of one size of array but is not a optimal way .

Linked list- linear data structure containing many nodes and nodes contain data as well as address of the next node.
Basically memory created in heap on run time.
So, we used linked list as it shrink or grow on run time in this way it is best way of memory management i.e.  no memory wastage.
Also , in linked list we don't have to shift the element for insertion or deletion .

Linked list are of three types-
1.Singly linked list
2.double linked list 
3.circular linked list
