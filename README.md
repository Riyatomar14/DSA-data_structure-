## 1.ARRAY-An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations. 

for example-

## remember -  “Location of next index depends on the data type we use”.

## Note- why indexes start with 0 ?

Because as it save the subtraction (operation) cost and hence some time.It is a more efficient way. 

Let us assume a 2D array and write a row-major formula  with two different approaches:

CASE1: array indices starting from 1
CASE2 :array indices starting from 0
let the 2D array be arr[m][n] of type int

let &arr be “address”
